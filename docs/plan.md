Yes, I know this trick 🙂
It’s a classic binary number / powers-of-two magic trick.

What’s actually happening

Each card represents a power of 2, and the number printed at the top-left corner of each card is the value of that card.

Usually the top-left numbers are like:
	•	1
	•	2
	•	4
	•	8
	•	16
	•	32
	•	(and so on)

How the trick works
	1.	You ask the person to think of a number (say between 1 and 63).
	2.	You show multiple cards, one by one.
	3.	For each card, you ask:
“Is your number present on this card?”
	4.	If they say YES, you add the number written at the top-left corner of that card.
	5.	After all cards are shown, the sum of those top-left numbers = the chosen number.

Why it always works

Every number can be uniquely represented in binary form.

Example:
Suppose the person thinks of 19

Binary of 19:

16 + 2 + 1

So:
	•	Card with 1 → YES
	•	Card with 2 → YES
	•	Card with 4 → NO
	•	Card with 8 → NO
	•	Card with 16 → YES

Now add the top-left values:

16 + 2 + 1 = 19

🎯 Correct every time.

Why those numbers appear on the cards

Each card contains all numbers that have that binary bit set.

For example:
	•	The 8 card contains: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25…
	•	The 4 card contains numbers where the 4’s bit is set
	•	And so on

If you want, I can:

	•	Explain how to code this trick in JS
	•	Or show how to perform it smoothly like a magician
